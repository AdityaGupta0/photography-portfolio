### Hi, I'm Aditya Gupta 

I have been doing photography as a hobby since 2020. My focus in photography is capturing moments that inspire awe in me. I primarily dabble in landscape and astrophotography. 

I started off with my iPhone's camera before progressing to a cheap used Sony a6000. Just recently though I've saved out to get myself a Sony a7C mk. II along with a couple lenses and a real tripod. 

While I mostly just do this for myself, I have done a couple projects for others. Most notably I filmed and edited videos for my robotics teams which were evaluated and ranked highly. I have also done a couple graduation photoshoots for making some quick money (but I'm still broke as hell).
